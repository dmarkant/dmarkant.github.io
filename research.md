Humans are active learners.
Our decisions shape how we learn about the world.
My research examines how people make choices about how and what they learn. 
In addition, finding the limits of such active control.

# Research interests

I am interested in the computational science of learning, where the goal is to understand the cognitive processes involved in human learning and decision making and their implications for real-world learning environments. My research has focused in particular on how people make <i>self-directed</i> decisions that affect the course of their own experience (e.g., controlling what information they see, which material to study, how long to search for a new idea, etc.).


1. Understanding the interaction of learning and decision making. I'm interested in types of learning that are active in that they don't just happen to you--they require active decision making about what or how to learn. 

1. My work involves behavioral experiments and computational modeling. From a modeling perspective, I believe in a pluralistic approach. Bayesian frameworks, heuristic methods from machine learning, serious consideration of plausible process models. 

1. I think that there's a lot to learn about human learning, and my principal goal is to 



# The benefits of self-directed control

Rule learning.

Memory.

Link to educational ideas.


# The limits of active learning

Hypothesis generation.

Difficult problem--how do people generate new ideas when their current beliefs donâ€™t seem to be right?


# Modeling uncertainty-driven search

Battleship, circle search.

How do people evaluate whether a question is a good one? 
Distinction between uncertainty and information.



# Adaptive exploration

When to stop collecting information.
