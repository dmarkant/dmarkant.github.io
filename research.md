Humans are active learners.
The information a person experiences is usually determined, at least in part, by 
choices that they make and how they exert control over their environment.

How do people control how they learn? How do they decide what information will 
be useful? How do cognitive constraints limit what they can learn on their own? 
When is learning more effective when directed by someone else, like a teacher 
or an algorithm?

My research examines the cognitive processes involved in human learning and decision
making and their implications for real-world learning environments. I use a combination
of behavioral experiments and computational modeling to understand how decision making
and learning interact. In particular, I’m interested in how people perceive uncertainty 
and use it to guide their own learning.
