I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://psych.uncc.edu">Department of Psychological Science
</a> at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. 
Prior to this I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality">Center for Adaptive Rationality</a>, within the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. 
In January 2014 I completed my Ph.D. in the <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/programs/cp/">Cognition and Perception</a> program at New York University.
I also worked in the <a href="http://pnl.bwh.harvard.edu">Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory</a> within Harvard Medical School, where I used structural and functional MRI to measure brain differences in psychiatric populations (e.g., PTSD and schizophrenia). I first became interested in cognitive science during my first year of undergraduate studies at Cornell (even though I pretended to be computer science major for a while).

I’m interested in how minds make learning possible. The aim of my research is to understand cognitive processes involved in human learning and decision making, how those processes are shaped by one’s environment, and what they imply for real-world learning problems (especially educational practices). 
For more information on the research I’ve done so far, please see the list of [publications](/publications).

<b>I am currently accepting applications for undergraduate and graduate positions in my lab at UNCC.</b> If you’re interested in doing some research on human cognition while learning some practical skills related to experimental design and data analysis, send me an email to learn how to apply.
