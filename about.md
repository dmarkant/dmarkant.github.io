I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality">Center for Adaptive Rationality</a>, within the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. In January 2014 I completed my Ph.D. in the <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/programs/cp/">Cognition and Perception</a> program at New York University, where I worked with Prof. <a href="http://smash.psych.nyu.edu/~gureckis/">Todd Gureckis</a>. 
Prior to that I worked in the <a href="http://pnl.bwh.harvard.edu">Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory</a> within Harvard Medical School, where I used structural and functional MRI to measure brain differences in psychiatric populations (e.g., PTSD and schizophrenia). I first became interested in cognitive science during my first year of undergraduate studies at Cornell (even though I pretended to be computer science major for a while).

I’m interested in how minds make learning possible. The aim of my research is to understand the cognitive processes involved in human learning and decision making, how those processes are shaped by the external environment, and what they imply for real-world learning problems (including educational practices). 
For more information on the research I’ve done so far, please see the list of [publications](/publications).
